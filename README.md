# Auto-mpg-Linear Regression and Regularization methods(Ridge and Lasso Regression)
Given data auto - mpg data set, different features (or explanatory variables), the aim is to predict the fuel consumption in MPG (miles per gallon).
Performed linear regression then for better accuracy perform Ridge and Lasso Regression.
After data exploration and cleaning, preprocessed original features and used them to train a Linear Regression.
For better accuracy performed Ridge and Lasso Regression.
Generate the polynomial(degree -2) feature space then performed Ridge and Lasso Regression.
